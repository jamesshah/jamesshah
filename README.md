### Hi there 👋
I am a final year IT Engineering student from India 🇮🇳. I'm currently learning Machine Learning algorithms and developing a Sign Language Recognition webapp using Convolutional Neural Networks(Deep Learning Model). I've worked on some full stack projects including but not limited to Video Call Web App using Twilio API, Covid-19 Case Updates and many more. I also write articles and share my learning process with the community. You can read my blog at [bytetales.co](https://bytetales.co). If you like my work, share some 💙 on [mail](mailto:james@bytetales.co). Feel free to reach out in case you want to get in touch.
