### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a final year IT Engineering student from India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³. I'm currently learning Machine Learning algorithms and developing a Sign Language Recognition webapp using Convolutional Neural Networks(Deep Learning Model). I've worked on some full stack projects including but not limited to Video Call Web App using Twilio API, Covid-19 Case Updates and many more. I also write articles and share my learning process with the community. You can read my blog at [bytetales.co](https://bytetales.co).
